### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, my first time seeing React was through the lecture so I have learned alot these past couple of days. Also beause things like modal and flexboxs was used in the past projects, I was able to feel more comfortable using and implementing these features again

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
Styled the website to look more user friendly. Add more features like sorting through more options. 

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Seeing all of the different ways my classmates styled inspired me to add more to my CSS. Specifically some of my classmates had a different cover image than the modal picture of the same movie and I really liked how that looked, so I added that to my own website
